		<h3>Computation for Public Policy: Final Project</h3>
		<p>For this final project, you can work individually or in teams of 2-4. If you would like to work in a group, feel free to use Piazza to reach out to other students that may be interested in the same areas as you. The goal of the final project is to employ the computational tools we have been learning to answer a research question that is interesting to you. If you are working on a piece of computational analysis for your thesis or personal research, feel free to propose it as your class project.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">You will be expected to: <ul>
        <li>Select an area of interest in public policy or social science. Define some questions youâ€™d like to answer using data. Write a short (1 page or less) proposal describing the project you plan to do and potential data sources.</li>
        <li>Collect datasets through some combination of open data and data collection (e.g. web scraping) and vet them.</li>
        <li>Perform computational analysis to answer your questions. This work will be done in a git repo that will be shared with the class.</li>
        <li>Present your results to the class during finals week.</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="col-md-12">Deliverables: <ul>
        <li>Proposal: Due <b>Friday, Feb 12th at 5pm by email to the mailing list</b>. Should include: <ul>
            <li>your group,</li> 
            <li>your area of interest, </li>
            <li>the data sources you will use, and </li> 
            <li>the questions you hope to answer. </li> 
		  </ul>
        <li>Git repository: Due 2/17. We will be grading you based on:
			<ul>
				<li>(30%) Clear, well-documented code. Unless you used private data that you cannot commit to your repository, we should be able to run your code to replicate your analysis.</li>
				<li>(5%) README.md: Use Markdown to create a README.md file in your repository that briefly (equivalent of 1 page) summarizes the purpose and findings of your project, including some tables and visualizations.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
        <li>Project presentation: During finals week. At least 10 minutes. For groups or 2 or more, at least 20 minutes but no more than 30 minutes. We will be looking for the following (but feel free to use a different outline):
			<ul>
				<li>(5%) Introduction and motivation: Why did you select this problem? </li>
				<li>(10%) Data: Describe your data including how you selected and collected it.</li>
			    <li>(25%) Analysis and Visualization </li>
				<li>(25%) Result: What does your work mean? What questions does it answer? </li>
			    <li>Further work: If you were to continue this work, what extensions would you pursue?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
