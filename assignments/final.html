		<h3>Computation for Public Policy: Final Project</h3>
		<p>For this final project, you can work individually or in teams of 2-4. If you would like to work in a group, feel free to use Piazza to reach out to other students that may be interested in the same areas as you. The goal of the final project is to employ the computational tools we have been learning to answer a research question that is interesting to you. If you are working on a piece of computational analysis for your thesis or personal research, feel free to propose it as your class project.</p>

	<div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">You will be expected to: <ul>
        <li>Select an area of interest in public policy or social science. Define some questions youâ€™d like to answer using data. Write a short (1 page or less) proposal describing the project you plan to do and potential data sources.</li>
        <li>Collect datasets through some combination of open data and data collection (e.g. web scraping) and vet them.</li>
        <li>Perform computational analysis to answer your questions. This work will be done in a git repo that will be shared with the class.</li>
        <li>Present your results to the class during finals week.</li>
